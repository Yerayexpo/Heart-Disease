# Heart Disease Prediction
### Introduction
Heart disease prediction using machine learning holds great promise in the field of healthcare. By identifying individuals at risk early on, it allows for proactive intervention and personalized treatment, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and reducing the burden of heart disease on society. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that machine learning models are not a substitute for medical expertise but rather a valuable tool to aid healthcare professionals in their decision-making process.
#### About the data
The dataset used for heart disease prediction, obtained from Kaggle, contains several features (columns) that provide valuable information for training machine learning models. Here is a brief description of each feature:

age: The age of the patient in years.

sex: The patient's sex (0 for female, 1 for male).

cp: Chest pain type experienced by the patient. It is categorized into four values:

        0: Typical angina (chest pain related to reduced blood flow to the heart).

        1: Atypical angina.

        2: Non-anginal pain.

        3: Asymptomatic (no chest pain).

trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) when the patient was admitted to the hospital.

chol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl) at the time of admission.

fbs: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl) indicating whether the patient's fasting blood sugar is higher than normal (1 for true, 0 for false).

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results. Categorized into three values:

        0: Normal.

        1: Abnormal ST-T wave.

        2: Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy.

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 for yes, 0 for no). It indicates whether the patient experienced angina (chest pain) during exercise.

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, which reflects abnormal heart activity.

slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

        0: Upsloping.

        1: Flat.

        2: Downsloping.

ca: The number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. It represents the number of major blood vessels obstructed by plaques.

thal: Thallium stress test result:

        1: Normal.

        2: Fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart).

        3: Reversible defect (a blood flow decrease during stress that returns to normal afterward).

target: The target variable that indicates the presence of heart disease:

        0: No heart disease.

        1: Presence of heart disease.

The goal of using this dataset is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on their medical characteristics. By training on historical data with known outcomes, the model can learn patterns and relationships to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This predictive model can then assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk and recommending appropriate interventions for early detection and effective management of heart disease.
